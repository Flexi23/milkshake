Installing
----------

See milkshake.html for an example installation.


Presets
-------

The presets are stored in Presets.js.  They are very similar to milkdrop presets, 
except they are formatted in JSON.  The convert_preset.py script is a handy tool to
convert your favority mildrop presets.  Most milkdrop presets are now working, and I've
included a nice set of working ones already in Presets.js.


Development
-----------

The project is still very much under development.  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.  Send pull requests on GitHub for any fixes or improvements you 
are able to make.
